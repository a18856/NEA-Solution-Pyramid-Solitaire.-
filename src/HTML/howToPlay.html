<h1>How to play</h1>
<br>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cards in the pyramid are exposed if no cards are overlapping them. Only one card from the draw pile is exposed at any given time in the game (the most recent draw pile card to be turned up is the only card from the draw pile that's exposed).</li>
  <li>When two exposed cards total 13, they can be discarded. (This is why this version of the game is sometimes referred to as Solitaire 13.) Discarding is always optional, and there may be times when it is a better tactical choice not to discard.</li>
  <li>For example, if a 9 and a 4 are both exposed in the pyramid, they can be discarded. If a 5 is exposed in the pyramid and an 8 is exposed after being turned up from the draw pile, they can be discarded.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Card Values</h2>
<br>
<p>Aces are worth 1, jacks are worth 11, queens are worth 12, and kings are worth 13.All other cards are worth their numerical value. Kings can be discarded as a single card.</p>
<h4>Here are some possible discard combinations: </h4>
<ul>
  <li>King: As a single card
  </li>
  <li>Queen + an ace
  </li>
  <li>Jack + No. 2 card
  </li>
  <li>No. 10 card + No. 3 card
  </li>
  <li>No. 9 card + No. 4 card
  </li>
  <li>No. 8 card + No. 5 card
  </li>
  <li>
    No. 7 card + No. 6 card
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>How to win</h2>
